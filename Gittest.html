				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<a id="About Me"></a>
				<section>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently graduated from secondary school, and I'm starting my first year in the real world. I make music, mostly hip-hop, but once in a while, I make beats for other genres. During the 6 months I was off-school, I saved up to buy a studio. I now own a low-end professional studio, which has served wonders for me. Music can be frustating. Sometimes it can be hard to get an end result, and I find often what I set out to do is never the same as the end product. In a way, it is similiar to programming. For example, when making this website, I was initially set on having each section be its' own color, but I couldn't figure out how to get rid of the white space in between the blocks. Eventually, I decided to group all the semantic elements for each section into a div element to create one huge block. I'm excited to see how much I will improve at creating web pages. I am certain I will be able to make what I initially set out to make very soon.</p> 
					<br>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, I have only been producing music for 3 months with no prior experience. The following songs are my favourite tracks I made:</p>
			    <dl>
            <dt><a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/suleimon-khawar/arabic-christmas-trap">Samsara</a></dt>
            <dd>Spooky, Trip hop, Trippy</dd>
            <dt><a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/suleimon-khawar/trapped-more-sub-bass">Trapped</a></dt>
            <dd>Trap, Bass heavy, Glued</dd>
          </dl>
					<br>
				  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also do track and field because it's good for your mental health. One of the downsides of programming is that your spending many hours is front of a laptop, which is not necessarily the best for your health, so I find that it is important to take care of my body through physical activity five times a week. Another sport I play every once in a while is soccer. I have been playing since 4, and it is my favourite sport. I found that I was losing interest in soccer for my last few years. The reason for this is, I find that a lot of people hog the ball, and I personally enjoy playing a game of soccer where everyone is doing quick passes. It feels way more satisfying getting a goal off a great play, than a kick and run.</p>

					  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, I recently graduated from higschool. I went to Vancouver Technical Secondary School in grades 8, 9, 11, and 12. In grade 10, I did a program called TREK. Basically, we did all of grade 10 in half a year, and for the other half we learned about the enviroment and went on a lot of outdoors trip. We did a 3-day long lodge trip, a kayaking trip at Tofino, and did other things, such as visit the water dam, etc. In highschool I was also doing french immersion. I'm really happy I took it as it helped me learn other languages (I consider music, and html languages) quicker. My top 3 highlights from highschool are:
						<ol>
						  <li>Prom</li>
						  <li>7 Day kayaking trip in tofino</li>
						  <li>Film class in Grade 12</li>
					  </ol>	
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I am at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcit.ca"><b>BCIT</b></a> for <abbr title="Computer Systems Technology">C.S.T.</abbr> I chose to do this program because I love being creative and building things from scratch. My goals for this program are:</p>
				    <ul>
              <li>Obtain a lot of programming experience</li>
              <li>Create a good network</li>  
				      <li>Figure out something new about myself</li>
            </ul>
					  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the courses I'm taking include:</p>
